Sleipnir is a graph editor framework leveraging the unity asset [Odin](http://sirenix.net/odininspector "Odin")

(pronounced “SLAYP-neer”; “The Sliding One”)

## Key features

- Almost non existing at runtime.
- Doesn't force any data structure on user - your graphs and nodes don't have to derive from any class.
- Uses Odin Inspector for displaying data.
- Editor data can be stored with Unity serialization.
