# Modifications

* Removed any kind of data binding - graphs are no longer scriptable objects and there is no base data structure that you have to follow, though you have to implement more interfaces. This way graphs can be both in-scene-oriented and assets-oriented.
* Multiple knobs for nodes.
* Colors, knobs descriptions.
* Connections can hold values.
* Nodes only show their content.

# TODO

* Visual styling upgrades to feel any polish :).
* Proper object right click context menu position when over node rect and zoomed out.
* Bringing back horizontal node scaling. I'm stupid sometimes.
* Solving height calculation problem to avoid lag.
* Attribute based collection wrapper class for default implementation.
* Solving random collection expands bug.
* Node equality.
* Removing interactions with graph from node rect.
* More sensible README.
