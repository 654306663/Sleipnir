* Easier to use then Unity's UIElements graph framework
* Focus on the logic of your graph based tool not the graph editor code that enables it
* Built on top of Unity's UIElements framework
* Graph data is available for runtime use (Runtime UI will come when unity makes UIElements work in the runtime - 2020)
